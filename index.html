        <h1 class="mainHeader">Social Engineering</h1>
        <p class="basicInfo"><strong>Social Engineering</strong> in a sense is basically trying to bypass the security of a computer system by the people who use/manage it rather than attacking it through the security of the system directly. There's many social engineering method but a big aspect would be the "social" part of it. Social Engineering relies on someone taking advantage of a person's lack of computer security and awareness. It basically bogs down to lying and scamming people. Here are a few examples of social engineering
        </p>
        <ul class="basicInfo">
          <li>
            <p>Pretend to be a help desk associate for a company and call the company asking for valuable information that can help gain you access to a computer system. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Disguise an e-mail to look legitimate and official but it actually contains malware/key loggers </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Walk inside a company building disguised as a security guard or IT associate to gain access to rooms or computers
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="basicInfo"><strong>Prevention</strong> of social engineering relies on company training and awareness. You could design the most perfect secure computer system with no flaws but if your employee gets scammed into giving out valuable information that could compromise everything, then it was all for nothing. It is important to be aware of the possibility you're being manipulated in e-mails, social situations, and downloads. Social engineering can occur in your everyday life as well. Some tips to not be a victim
        </p>
        <ul class="basicInfo">
          <li>
            <p>Be mindful of the source. Where is this e-mail coming from? Who is this person? What company is this person working for?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>It sounds too good to be true. That e-mail saying a nigerian prince is in dire need of help and will give you money in return? Yeah that's not going to work out. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Don't download any random files. If you have to download a random file and you're sketched out about it, I recommend sandboxing it or running it in a clean virtual machine.
